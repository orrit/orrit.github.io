### 2.2.2. HTML Elements

- HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages
- HTML elements are represented by tags
- HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
- Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page

### 2.2.3. HTML Tags

- HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets
- HTML tags normally come in pairs like `<p>` and `</p>`
- The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
- The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name
- Start and end tags are also called opening tags and closing tags

### 2.2.4. HTML Attributes

- HTML elements can have attributes
- Attributes provide additional information about elements
- Attributes are always specified in the start tag
- Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

- `<h1>` defines the most important heading. `<h6>` defines the least important heading

### 2.2.6. HTML Paragraphs

- Browsers automatically add some space (margin) before and after each `<p>` element. The margins can be modified with CSS (with the margin properties)
